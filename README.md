# TxtSpy
This program was designed to monitor a file directory where one text file was constantly being modified. 
The contents of a chosen text file will be printed when a file in this directory is modified.

Here's a demonstration:

Another thing I made in my spare time that I didn't know where to put so now it's in this repo :)
I made it speed things up when debugging another project of mine, double clicking it will clear the specified text file.
